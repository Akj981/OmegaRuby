					<h3 id="content">Malcolm Tsang - Student #: s3333925</h3>
					<p>Malcolm was born in Australia and is of Chinese descent.  Despite not being able to speak it, he is able to understand spoken Cantonese.  Malcolm has previously completed a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering at RMIT, and is a big sports fan â€“ particularly of Australian Rules Football and soccer, where he supports Essendon FC and Manchester United respectively.<br><br> His interests in IT began with playing computer games against his brother and the fascination of how the technology and games constantly improved over time.  It is this innovation and constant improving technology that gets me interested into thinking what is next?  Malcolm does not yet have any relevant IT experience.</p>

							<h3>Darren Miral - Student #: s3858795</h3>
							<p>Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia to Sri Lankan immigrants, Darren is undertaking his second Bachelor Degree, having previously obtained one form Monash University in 2012.  He has an intellectual curiosity regarding a number of subjects such as history, astronomy, chemistry and fine art and loves quiz shows. <br><br>Like many others, his interests in information technology stems from video games.  He feels that his enjoyment of troubleshooting, both in the context of IT and elsewhere, would be put to good use in the IT field.  Unfortunately, he has no IT experience prior to undertaking a Bachelor of IT degree from RMIT via OUA beyond building a PC and setting up a NAS on his home network to store multimedia files.</p>

							<h3>Van Nguyen - Student #: s3824188</h3>
							<p>Van is an Australian of Vietnamese origin.  He has previous commenced, but not completed, an Engineering degree.  After working for a couple of years, Van instead decided to complete a Diploma of IT at Victoria University after it was pointed out to him by family that he spent a lot of time around computers. <br> <br>Van developed an interest in Linux based systems after being introduced to it as a free, open-source operating system during his engineering degree.  He enjoys disassembling and fixing a number of electronics such as desktop computers, laptops and Android mobile phones.  As a result of his prior IT studies, Van has a number of IT skills at present mostly in web development and design, including PHP, Bootstrap, SQL and Python.</p>

							<h3>Sisi Meng Shih Liu - Student #: s3855898</h3>
							<p>An Australian of Chinese origin, Sisi moved to Hong Kong and currently works as an account manager that deals with the client facing aspects of various IT financing solutions.  This occurred after beginning and then deferring a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Sydney / University of New England.  She has a keen interest in wine, so much so that she completed a level 1 course at the Asia Wine Service and Education Centre, travel running, and Korean Culture.  She is able to speak English, Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as Korean to a basic level. <br><br>She has no formal IT experience, but has worked closely with various teams for a number of years that has required some IT knowledge.  Her interest in IT was sparked by her work and a desire to be able to better understand and explain the IT aspects of her job to clients.  She hopes to one day transition into a technical related position.</p>

							<h3>Minh Hau Truong - Student #: s3859157</h3>
							<p>Minh is originally from Vietnam, and moved to Australia 8 years ago.  He is a married father of a four-month-old boy which now takes up a lot of his time.   He has previously completed an Advanced Diploma of Business Administration but after working in the relevant field found that the work did not suit him. <br><br>Spending a lot of time with computers when he was younger learning for school and studying a new language piqued his interest in information technology.  He is also fascinated by the ongoing innovation and development of various technology products, be that the constant change of mobile phones from the bulky items of the 90s to the comparatively smaller but more feature rich ones of today, or the increasing use of robots and artificial intelligence to make life easier and more efficient. Minh has no prior IT experience.</p>
